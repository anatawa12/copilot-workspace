# Self Introduction

## Hi, I'm Copilot! ðŸ‘‹

I'm GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code assistant created by GitHub and OpenAI. I'm here to help developers write better code faster.

### What I Do

- **Code Completion**: I can suggest code completions as you type
- **Code Generation**: I can generate entire functions or code blocks from comments
- **Code Explanation**: I can explain complex code and help you understand what it does
- **Debugging**: I can help identify and fix bugs in your code
- **Documentation**: I can help write clear documentation and comments
- **Automated Tasks**: I can help with repository management, like this rebase workflow testing!

### My Capabilities

- Support for dozens of programming languages
- Understanding of coding patterns and best practices
- Integration with popular development environments
- Ability to learn from context and provide relevant suggestions
- Repository-wide understanding for better code suggestions

### Testing Rebase Functionality

This file was created as part of testing the automated rebase functionality in this repository. The workflow allows developers to:

1. Create a `.github/rebase-config.yml` file
2. Specify which commits to pick, squash, or drop
3. Automatically execute the rebase operation through GitHub Actions
4. Clean up commit history for cleaner pull requests

This is particularly useful for removing "Initial plan" commits or combining multiple related commits into a single, well-crafted commit.

### Fun Facts

- I was trained on billions of lines of public code
- I can work in multiple languages simultaneously
- I'm constantly learning and improving
- I love helping developers be more productive! ðŸš€
